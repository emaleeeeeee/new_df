1,"Great hardware, but software doesn't work.  Do not buy unless you want to project from HDMI source only.","I very rarely write reviews on Amazon, but I feel compelled to write a review for this product because there is relatively little public information online about it.  From an engineering perspective, the device is amazing - it's small and powerful, with good brightness for its size.  And if all you want to do is plug in an HDMI cable and project, you'll be happy.  However, to me, the real promise of this device was that it runs Android and should be able to operate entirely wirelessly via apps or casting, and these functions simply do not work.  Here's the deal:The Nebula Capsule does indeed run Android, but it doesn't have Google Play and most apps that you'd want to use are either not available or do not work.  For example, I was trying to watch the Olympics and the NBC Olympics app wouldn't install because Play Services aren't available.  NBC Sports installs ok but doesn't work because it needs the user to log in via a web browser and the Nebula doesn't have a browser.  The story was pretty much the same for all other apps I tried - they are either unavailable in the limited app store provided by the Nebula, they are available but won't install, or they install but don't work.Now, in theory you shouldn't have to install any apps on the Nebula because you should be able to cast from your smartphone to the Nebula.  However, casting is simply not functional from an Android phone - the Nebula doesn't show up in the casting options.  Nebula support says this is because the App isn't yet verified by Google Play, but I'm skeptical because the Nebula does show up in casting options from an iPhone but the casting is super-flaky.  Over the course of about three weeks with the device, I've tried to cast roughly 50 times.  Roughly 50% of the time it simply doesn't cast, and the app on my iPhone just goes blank while the Nebule is also blank.  The other 50% of the time it casts for a random interval of 1-10 minutes and then fails for no obvious reason.Overall, the hardware on this device is amazing, but the software is simply not ready for prime time.  I'll try buying one again in a few months, maybe.",2.0,2018-03-03 00:00:00.000,great hardware but software doesnt work do not buy unless you want to project from hdmi source only,i very rarely write review on amazon but i feel compel to write a review for this product because there be relatively little public information online about it from an engineer perspective the device be amaze its small and powerful with good brightness for its size and if all you want to do be plug in an hdmi cable and project youll be happy however to me the real promise of this device be that it run android and should be able to operate entirely wirelessly via apps or cast and these function simply do not work heres the dealthe nebula capsule do indeed run android but it doesnt have google play and most apps that youd want to use be either not available or do not work for example i be try to watch the olympics and the nbc olympics app wouldnt install because play service arent available nbc sport install ok but doesnt work because it need the user to log in via a web browser and the nebula doesnt have a browser the story be pretty much the same for all other apps i try they be either unavailable in the limit app store provide by the nebula they be available but will not install or they install but dont worknow in theory you shouldnt have to install any apps on the nebula because you should be able to cast from your smartphone to the nebula however cast be simply not functional from an android phone the nebula doesnt show up in the cast options nebula support say this be because the app isnt yet verify by google play but im skeptical because the nebula do show up in cast options from an iphone but the cast be superflaky over the course of about three weeks with the device ive try to cast roughly time roughly of the time it simply doesnt cast and the app on my iphone just go blank while the nebule be also blank the other of the time it cast for a random interval of minutes and then fail for no obvious reasonoverall the hardware on this device be amaze but the software be simply not ready for prime time ill try buy one again in a few months maybe,"['rarely', 'write', 'review', 'amazon', 'feel', 'compel', 'write', 'review', 'product', 'relatively', 'little', 'public', 'information', 'online', 'engineer', 'perspective', 'device', 'amaze', 'small', 'powerful', 'good', 'brightness', 'size', 'want', 'plug', 'hdmi', 'cable', 'project', 'youll', 'happy', 'however', 'real', 'promise', 'device', 'run', 'android', 'able', 'operate', 'entirely', 'wirelessly', 'via', 'apps', 'cast', 'function', 'simply', 'work', 'heres', 'dealthe', 'nebula', 'capsule', 'indeed', 'run', 'android', 'doesnt', 'google', 'play', 'apps', 'youd', 'want', 'use', 'either', 'available', 'work', 'example', 'try', 'watch', 'olympics', 'nbc', 'olympics', 'app', 'wouldnt', 'install', 'play', 'service', 'arent', 'available', 'nbc', 'sport', 'install', 'ok', 'doesnt', 'work', 'need', 'user', 'log', 'via', 'web', 'browser', 'nebula', 'doesnt', 'browser', 'story', 'pretty', 'much', 'apps', 'try', 'either', 'unavailable', 'limit', 'app', 'store', 'provide', 'nebula', 'available', 'install', 'install', 'dont', 'worknow', 'theory', 'shouldnt', 'install', 'apps', 'nebula', 'able', 'cast', 'smartphone', 'nebula', 'however', 'cast', 'simply', 'functional', 'android', 'phone', 'nebula', 'doesnt', 'show', 'cast', 'options', 'nebula', 'support', 'say', 'app', 'isnt', 'yet', 'verify', 'google', 'play', 'im', 'skeptical', 'nebula', 'show', 'cast', 'options', 'iphone', 'cast', 'superflaky', 'course', 'three', 'weeks', 'device', 'ive', 'try', 'cast', 'roughly', 'time', 'roughly', 'time', 'simply', 'doesnt', 'cast', 'app', 'iphone', 'go', 'blank', 'nebule', 'blank', 'time', 'cast', 'random', 'interval', 'minutes', 'fail', 'obvious', 'reasonoverall', 'hardware', 'device', 'amaze', 'software', 'simply', 'ready', 'prime', 'time', 'ill', 'try', 'buy', 'months', 'maybe']","['great', 'hardware', 'software', 'doesnt', 'work', 'buy', 'unless', 'want', 'project', 'hdmi', 'source']"
2,"I’m keeping it, but...","The stripped-down version of Android is a real bummer, I must say. Kills the potential of this projector. It’s still better than all the other mini models, but it also costs a lot more, too, so I was hoping for more.The good:* Picture is bright enough in a dim room and great in a dark room. My walls are beige, not white, and it performs fine without a screen. I’m getting a screen soon, so I’ll update when I do. It’s still a mini projector, and portability is going to come with compromise.* I like the form factor. It fits nicely in a case made for the Amazon Tap speaker; it’s shorter than the speaker but about the same width, so I got that case and put in a bit of springy foam as support. There’s room for the power cord, also, though not the remote. (This $7 hack was better than the $40 case made for the Nebula.)* Sound is impressive for a small speaker that’s more than a speaker. It’s as loud as my Anker SoundCore, which is loud enough for my needs. Won’t fill a large room, but is perfectly serviceable for a few people watching a movie.* The interface is fine. It’s what you would expect from any non-standard Android iteration.* The two apps I tested which support downloads on other mobile devices also support downloads here (Netflix and Amazon). So I can conceivably download a season of whatever old show I’m bingeing at the moment and not require any additional devices.* The iOS app which accompanies the device is great. A much smoother experience than remote only, although the remote is perfectly useable as well. I like that there are two modes - mouse and “control”, which each serve a specific purpose to navigate most effectively. And there’s a full touch keyboard which helpfully allows you to skip the whole painful hunt and peck process which the remote requires.* Battery life claims seem about right, based on one usage period.And now the bad:* No Google Play store, meaning no access to the apps I want. I bought this mainly for one specific app, which I cannot install. Streaming from another device works, but the whole reason I opted for an Android-enabled device was to have access to apps. Granted, my app isn’t top ten most popular Play Store fare, but it shouldn’t matter. This is an Android device. That’s deeply disappointing. I nearly returned it because of that (except that the other options which do allow me to install my app perform at a much lower level in general).* Light is within acceptable limits for a mini projector, but based on price and design, I don’t see why they couldn’t have packed a bit more brightness in this thing.* The Netflix app requires the iOS app to function. It doesn’t support the remote control. What??? Why?* Controls on the device itself are minimal, and do not allow it to function without the remote. If you lose the remote, you may lose the ability to operate your device. The app probably mitigates that issue, except that already twice I’ve encountered some interface struggles that I could only resolve using the back button on the remote (not in the app).  So maybe it doesn’t. Don’t lose your remote.* No USB ports. There’s a microUSB to USB dongle which allows for a USB connection of a thumb drive or whatever, but it’s a dongle. I hate dongles. One more thing to forget/lose.  Would it have been so hard to add a single USB port??...Overall it’s a good device. Certainly better than other mini projectors I’ve tried. If you’re satisfied with the apps their stripped-down OS seems worthy of download, you’ll be happy with the device. I’m keeping it even with my complaints simply because the speaker is great, it isn’t super buggy like other devices in the same genre, and I’m not going to find a better option than this. But there’s just no good reason I can see to omit Play Store.",3.0,2018-04-26 00:00:00.000,i be keep it but,the strippeddown version of android be a real bummer i must say kill the potential of this

6,"2 weeks, 7 etc support calls and  $76 worth of hdmi cables and connectors but still doesn’t work.","Mine had a ton of problems. I called customer support about 5 times and ultimately couldn’t get it to work. When I clicked on Netflix on the home screen it would neither download Netflix nor play Netflix. So I called and they gave me a work around, a google play password to download the google store. I did that only to find that there was no enter button. Not on the remote or on the iPhone nebula connect app. So I called again and they told me to hold down the mouse button on the remote until I got a pointing hand cursor which I could use my remote arrows to navigate around. Finally I could scroll down enough to get to the enter button. Success!  Google play store finally downloaded. A series of steps was completed and I restarted after the install. Now I went to try to download Netflix. I typed netflix in the search window but Netflix didn’t appear. So I couldn’t download the app. Giving up on that, I tried to download amazon prime from the google play app because that’s the other way I watch movies. Well I found amazon prime app and I downloaded it, but when I tried to log in I kept getting stuck at the Captcha. Again and again and again and again I’d enter my very long password with that cumbersome remote. And then when I’d enter the captcha it would say there was an error. This was supposed to be plug n play. Open the capsule. Click Netflix from the home screen. Log in and watch my Netflix!!! By now it’s 2 weeks and about 7 phone calls to customer service in and I still can’t play a movie from my projector. What can I do?  I can project my photos using screen mirroring. But that’s kinda boring. And o can’t screen mirror movies From Amazon prime or Netflix because it is copyrighted and it won’t screen mirror.So next customer service tells Me that I should try hardwiring my phone to the projector. That way if I am playing Netflix or Amazon prime on my phone it will go through the HDMI cable and directly into the Nebula and will project! This is not the point and shoot I was hoping for but I was excited to try it. After spending $56 on an Apple proprietary lightning cable to HDMI set up, and another $18 on an HDMI to HDMI cable, I was ready to watch a movie!  But no.  I connected my phone the other cables to the Nebula and no matter what I did the Nebula just did not see the HDMI input. Even though I bought the fancy made for iPhone proprietary cable connectors. So now I’ve spent $300 on the Nebula and I’ve spent $76 on cables and the thing just doesn’t work. They have advanced my customer service to a higher level of tech-support and no one can help me so I am returning it. I am going to have them send me another a capsule. Maybe this one was defective?

7,A Good Attempt but Needs Improvement,"I purchased the Nebula Capsule Smart Mini Projector as a gift so I can not review it for long term use.I inspected the projector to ensure it works because it is going to family overseas and can not easily be exchanged if needed.  I am happy I did this because there was a small problem with the remote.  The battery door was broken and would not stay in place.  Anker contacted me directly via email to ask about the purchase and when I informed them of the problem they had a new remote to me in 3 days.  I am always impressed with Anker's customer service.I attached the Nebula Capsule to a camera tripod and found it fit perfectly.It powered on with an almost full charge out of the box.  The one I purchased is black and it has a slick look.  As described it is similar in size and weight to a can of soda.The material quality is top-notch.  The casing feels like it is built to last, mostly of metal.The size makes it very portable.  I paired it with a hard-shell travel case for safer transportation.It comes with a wall charger and cable.  If you wish to use it while  charging I would recommend purchasing a longer cable as the included one is short.I was not impressed with the app interface.  Using the included remote is clunky and for using my phone as a remote I am forced to have both the bluetooth and location turned on even when connected to the same wifi router.The Nebula Capsule has an app store of sorts but many of the more popular services did not work. No Hulu. No Prime. Netflix worked but the interface is poor;  namely it would freeze while searching and then scrolls up or down for no reason.  YouTube is available but it did not have an option for me to sign into my account.The sound quality is not great.  It does get loud but loud does not equal clear audio.  It is not in stero and I did not see a way to connect to external speakers.  There may be a way but I was only testing the basics.The picture quality is not full HD but good for a portable projector in this price range. The room needs to be almost completely dark.I think it would work well for a basement room or any room with no windows. Otherwise I can not see it working well without blackout curtains or waiting for night fall.The portability is nice and I can see the four hour play time working well for (night time) outdoor use while camping or just enjoy a nice night outside.For the price I would recommend it but barely.  There is a lot of room for improvement for any future models Anker may produce.",3.0,,a good attempt but need improvement,i purchase the nebula capsule smart mini projector as a gift so i can not review it for long term usei inspect the projector to ensure it work because it be go to family overseas and can not easily be exchange if need i be happy i do this because there be a small problem with the remote the battery door be break and would not stay in place anker contact me directly via email to ask about the purchase and when i inform them of the problem they have a new remote to me in days i be always impress with ankers customer servicei attach the nebula capsule to a camera tripod and find it fit perfectlyit power on with an almost full charge out of the box the one i purchase be black and it have a slick look as describe it be similar in size and weight to a can of sodathe material quality be topnotch the case feel like it be build to last mostly of metalthe size make it very portable i pair it with a hardshell travel case for safer transportationit come with a wall charger and cable if you wish to use it while charge i would recommend purchase a longer cable as the include one be shorti be not impress with the app interface use the include remote be clunky and for use my phone as a remote i be force to have both the bluetooth and location turn on even when connect to the same wifi routerthe nebula capsule have an app store of sort but many of the more popular service do not work no hulu no prime netflix work but the interface be poor namely it would freeze while search and then scroll up or down for no reason youtube be available but it do not have an option for me to sign into my accountthe sound quality be not great it do get loud but loud do not equal clear audio it be not in stero and i do not see a way to connect to external speakers there may be a way but i be only test the basicsthe picture quality be not full hd but good for a portable projector in this price range the room need to be almost completely darki think it would work well for a basement room or any room with no windows otherwise i can not see it work well without blackout curtain or wait for night fallthe portability be nice and i can see the four hour play time work well for night time outdoor use while camp or just enjoy a nice night outsidefor the price i would recommend it but barely there be a lot of room for improvement for any future model anker may produce,"['purchase', 'nebula', 'capsule', 'smart', 'mini', 'projector', 'gift', 'review', 'long', 'term', 'usei', 'inspect', 'projector', 'ensure', 'work', 'go', 'family', 'overseas', 'easily', 'exchange', 'need', 'happy', 'small', 'problem', 'remote', 'battery', 'door', 'break', 'stay', 'place', 'anker', 'contact', 'directly', 'via', 'email', 'ask', 'purchase', 'inform', 'problem', 'new', 'remote', 'days', 'always', 'impress', 'ankers', 'customer', 'servicei', 'attach', 'nebula', 'capsule', 'camera', 'tripod', 'find', 'fit', 'perfectlyit', 'power', 'almost', 'full', 'charge', 'box', 'purchase', 'black', 'slick', 'look', 'describe', 'similar', 'size', 'weight', 'sodathe', 'material', 'quality', 'topnotch', 'case', 'feel', 'like', 'build', 'last', 'mostly', 'metalthe', 'size', 'make', 'portable', 'pair', 'hardshell', 'travel', 'case', 'safer', 'transportationit', 'come', 'wall', 'charger', 'cable', 'wish', 'use', 'charge', 'recommend', 'purchase', 'longer', 'cable', 'include', 'shorti', 'impress', 'app', 'interface', 'use', 'include', 'remote', 'clunky', 'use', 'phone', 'remote', 'force', 'bluetooth', 'location', 'turn', 'even', 'connect', 'wifi', 'routerthe', 'nebula', 'capsule', 'app', 'store', 'sort', 'many', 'popular', 'service', 'work', 'hulu', 'prime', 'netflix', 'work', 'interface', 'poor', 'namely', 'freeze', 'search', 'scroll', 'reason', 'youtube', 'available', 'option', 'sign', 'accountthe', 'sound', 'quality', 'great', 'get', 'loud', 'loud', 'equal', 'clear', 'audio', 'stero', 'see', 'way', 'connect', 'external', 'speakers', 'may', 'way', 'test', 'basicsthe', 'picture', 'quality', 'full', 'hd', 'good', 'portable', 'projector', 'price', 'range', 'room', 'need', 'almost', 'completely', 'darki', 'think', 'work', 'well', 'basement', 'room', 'room', 'windows', 'otherwise', 'see', 'work', 'well', 'without', 'blackout', 'curtain', 'wait', 'night', 'fallthe', 'portability', 'nice', 'see', 'four', 'hour', 'play', 'time', 'work', 'well', 'night', 'time', 'outdoor', 'use', 'camp', 'enjoy', 'nice', 'night', 'outsidefor', 'price', 'recommend', 'barely', 'lot', 'room', 'improvement', 'future', 'model', 'anker', 'may', 'produce']","['good', 'attempt', 'need', 'improvement']"
8,"Lovely outside, but the guts on this unit leaves something to be desired.","Out of the box the unit itself is a solid piece of hardware, well constructed, metal grill over the speakers and a thick chasis that looks like it can take a fall or two without hurting the unit itself, the lens is recessed far enough that it won't get scratched easily but for that extra layer of protection a small bag is included with the packaging.So that's the good... what about the bad?The operating system being Android 7.1 is fine but even with the basic apps (youtube, netflix, opera browser) I've already taken up over half of the built in memory. That doesn't leave much room for videos etc. While the usb port may be used for expanded memory (although one raises the issue on how you would charge the unit) the fact that you don't have a micro sd slot seems like a poor design decision.As far as apps are concerned Youtube is problematic because I can't seem to login to my youtube account despite me pressing the ""login"" button many times it just doesn't respond. Netflix responded ok so that's a big plus.The remote control app that I downloaded on my phone is fine although it can get a bit sluggish and swapping back and forth from keyboard and mouse can get frustrating.Framerate wise this projector can get choppy so please keep that in mind especially if you are a gamer...To summarize..The GoodBuild qualityPortabilityKeystoning is a breeze and the focus is greatBrightness if you don't need 100 inches or more and you are in a dark room, for me this unit is fine for the netflix ceiling projector binge watching.The BadDespite this being an Android system your app store is limited as it's not linked to Google PlayOnboard ram/rom is not sufficient for a smooth experienceYoutube app is buggyRemote control app seems buggyAirplay for me had quite a bit of lag and framerate lossTo sum things up, I got this on sale so I'm not angry about the purchase. Will this replace my TV? No. Not at all. Is this a handy little thing to have to bring out at parties, camping trips, or on the road? Definitely in fact that's where this unit shines the best.

11,Almost love it. Not worth the price.,"This was so expensive, $300. So I was hoping it would be everything I was hoping for. i mean, its decent, but for the price? It has some shortcomings.The sound is not good, and they brag so about it. You’ll want to hook a Bluetooth speaker up.The fan inside is super loud. So the poor sound quality struggles to overpower it. Hook that Bluetooth speaker up.The remote control sucks. You have to be pointing directly at the back of the nebula in order for it to register, which is extremely inconvenient.The app that lets you control the nebula from your phone, yeah, that sucks too. Connective issues, frustrating controls that don’t always work.Apps are limited and outdated through their own Apptoid Store. Annoying.Some apps have issues, and can’t be used with the remote control, like Netflix. You HAVE to use the crappy phone app.The battery life only lasts one movie. But you can use it while it’s plug in. Get a portable charger.(Might at well get a bigger projector with better sound and battery life.)You’re not able to adjust screen size or angle on your own. Sometimes it corrects angle on its own, sometimes it doesn’t. Annoying. Screen size can only be adjusted by physically moving the nebula closer or farther away from the screen. So sometimes you are just not able to get the size you need or want. It can be difficult or impossible in some of the spaces you will be in. And you will have to watch your movie on a screen that is either entirely too small or too big.It’s a decent projector, but is not worth what they are charging when it has so many short comings. I’m sure there are more, and I will add them as I notice and remember.",3.0,2020-05-16 00:00:00.000,almost love it not worth the price,this be so expensive so i be hop it would be everything i be hop for i mean its decent but for the price it have some shortcomingsthe sound be not good and they brag so about it you will want to hook a bluetooth speaker upthe fan inside be super loud so the poor sound quality struggle to overpower it hook that bluetooth speaker upthe remote control suck you have to be point directly at the back of the nebula in order for it to register which be extremely inconvenientthe app that let you control the nebula from your phone yeah that suck too connective issue frustrate control that do not always workapps be limit and outdated through their own apptoid store annoyingsome apps have issue and can not be use with the remote control like netflix you have to use the crappy phone appthe battery life only last one movie but you can use it while it be plug in get a portable chargermight at well get a bigger projector with better sound and battery lifeyou be not able to adjust screen size or angle on your own sometimes it correct angle on its own sometimes it do not annoy screen size can only be adjust by physically move the nebula closer or farther away from the screen so sometimes you be just not able to get the size you need or want it can be difficult or impossible in some of the space you will be in and you will have to watch your movie on a screen that be either entirely too small or too bigit be a decent projector but be not worth what they be charge when it have so many short come i be sure there be more and i will add them as i notice and remember,"['expensive', 'hop', 'everything', 'hop', 'mean', 'decent', 'price', 'shortcomingsthe', 'sound', 'good', 'brag', 'want', 'hook', 'bluetooth', 'speaker', 'upthe', 'fan', 'inside', 'super', 'loud', 'poor', 'sound', 'quality', 'struggle', 'overpower', 'hook', 'bluetooth', 'speaker', 'upthe', 'remote', 'control', 'suck', 'point', 'directly', 'back', 'nebula', 'order', 'register', 'extremely', 'inconvenientthe', 'app', 'let', 'control', 'nebula', 'phone', 'yeah', 'suck', 'connective', 'issue', 'frustrate', 'control', 'always', 'workapps', 'limit', 'outdated', 'apptoid', 'store', 'annoyingsome', 'apps', 'issue', 'use', 'remote', 'control', 'like', 'netflix', 'use', 'crappy', 'phone', 'appthe', 'battery', 'life', 'last', 'movie', 'use', 'plug', 'get', 'portable', 'chargermight', 'well', 'get', 'bigger', 'projector', 'better', 'sound', 'battery', 'lifeyou', 'able', 'adjust', 'screen', 'size', 'angle', 'sometimes', 'correct', 'angle', 'sometimes', 'annoy', 'screen', 'size', 'adjust', 'physically', 'move', 'nebula', 'closer', 'farther', 'away', 'screen', 'sometimes', 'able', 'get', 'size', 'need', 'want', 'difficult', 'impossible', 'space', 'watch', 'movie', 'screen', 'either', 'entirely', 'small', 'bigit', 'decent', 'projector', 'worth', 'charge', 'many', 'short', 'come', 'sure', 'add', 'notice', 'remember']","['almost', 'love', 'worth', 'price']"

15,Does not work well with Airplay for iPad,"I bought this projector because I wanted to use it in my classroom to airplay from my iPad. I thought it was perfect because it was small, wireless (no cords!!!!!), and I could easily move it around my room. Once I got it and began using it, however, I realized that airplay from the projector to my iPad is very slow, sometimes unresponsive, and now won't even connect. The other issue is that it's really not very bright unless you have a very dark room. This is an issue for my classroom because my students still need enough light to write their notes.

28,Youtube sign in tip/trick,I was absolutely shocked at the top tier quality of this product. The fact that I can use this in a well lit room is mind blowing!One major issue though. The apps. Specifically YouTube. Upon initial attempts the app continues to crash and unfortunately this has been mentioned in prior reviews multiple times and it doesn’t appear as though Anker isn’t too vested in resolving this. Nonetheless I found a slight lifehack for this Nebula!“Watch on tv”If you’re signed into YouTube on your phone and you have a playlist you’d like to access or if you PAY for no commercials .. this is the simplest method of having YouTube recognize your account while projected.1. Go to settings (within YouTube) on the Nebula (you MAY have to select “more settings”)2. Scroll down to “Link with TV code”  2a. Once the code generates go to step 33. Open YouTube up in your mobile app and go to settings4. Select “watch on tv” it should then ask you to enter the code you will see projected via Nebula.Keep in mind this will only have specified videos you select on YouTube via your phone be played and recognized but not your entire YouTube profile.Option 2Signing in.This app crashes ALL the time when you hit “sign in” in the top right corner of YouTube. After many different techy methods I was able to get signed in. I’ll be honest I will provide steps to the best of my recollection (again I tried like 101 ways)1. Expand the navigation pane on the left side and scroll down to subscriptions or library2. Once the sign in option generates sign in .. now it should allow you to enter your username and password.3.

122,"Useless for streaming (while using external bluetooth speaker) ... anything (sort of, see update)","Update II:I exchanged the unit in the hope that the new one would behave better with respect to simultaneous streaming and bluetooth connection to an external speaker. No dice, unfortunately. The problem still exists , sadly. This has nothing to do with the available wireless bandwidth as far as I can tell. The Capsule is connected to a 5GHz wireless-N network which provides 30-40 Mbps at the location of the machine; measured using speedtest.net on an iPhone 5S. Furthermore, the internal battery lasts about 2 hours, most definitely not 4 when playing video, and that's on the 'dim' screen setting. Funny enough, even when it is plugged into the wall, the battery keeps draining when watching a video and using the internal speaker. This was definitely unexpected and reminds me of old Android phones that weren't able to charge while using the GPS due to that component's current draw. You'd hope that a projector would run indefinitely when plugged in ... not so much. So, back to 3 stars.Update:I am adding a star (and a half, 3.5 starts total) based on customer service and the fact that I was able to isolate what looks like a firmware bug. The streaming (Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube) problems described below only occur when the box is connected to an external bluetooth speaker or headphone set; no problems using the HDMI port, or playing files from storage attached via USB. This is a bummer, of course, since bluettoth connectivity is able to sidestep the small speaker built into the unit. It's a 100% reproducible bug; I used an Anker Premium Stereo Speaker and Anker Soundbuds to test this, so all three being from the same company, there shouldn't be compatibility issues, you'd think. Let's see if Anker engineers can figure this one out. We do like the Nebula, so here's to hoping that this issue can be fixed.Original Review:Let me start with the good. The device is well made and feels very solid. Great packaging as well, for those who care;-) It is ultra portable, has an HDMI input, can mirror the screen of your iPhone (either via HDMI or AirPlay, the latter shows some lag, so no good for gaming), and plays video from a USB-connected storage device. Since it is based on Android and has built-in WiFi and Bluetooth, it can run applications, such as those used to stream video content either from a local server or the internet (Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube, Plex). With its built-in rechargeable battery and speaker, it is really something I could see myself bringing on a trip. While the built-in speaker isn't anything to write home about, it will keep the kids happy enough; a nice feature is the ability to connect an external Bluetooth speaker or headphones (see firmware bug described in the update).Sadly, not all is well at this point.First thing after receiving the Nebula was installing Netflix, Amazon Video, Youtube, and Plex after upgrading to the latest firmware version. Despite the Nebula being placed in the same room as the WiFi router, which is connected via a high-speed cable modem to the internet, streaming failed within 60 seconds for all of the above-listed apps; I tried clearing the cache and also rebooted the device, no improvement. I imagine that this has something to do with the buffering algorithm. I even lowered the streaming quality within the Amazon Video app, and it still didn’t change the behavior.I should mention that streaming to a Roku, a FireTV Stick, iPads, and iPhones never results in buffer problems despite those devices being located nowhere near the WiFi router. I didn't find an option to manually enter a DNS address to see if that might help.Needless to say that one of the key features of the device is the ability to operate it in a portable / standalone fashion. If none of the streaming services work, not even streaming DVD-quality video (not HD) from a local server using Plex, what's the point?I reported the problem to Anker and hope to hear back from them shortly. We have several Bluetooth speakers from Anker which we are very happy with, and I have had a good customer service experience with Anker in the past, which was one of the reasons why I went with the Nebula. I am keeping my fingers crossed that this can be resolved since the product has a lot of potential.",3.0,,useless for stream while use external bluetooth speaker anything sort of see update,update iii

255,Sadly dissappointed yet simultaneously awed,"I would have loved to say that I'm happy with this product and that it is what I expected.....but I would be lying. I AM DISSAPPOINTED.  I received my capsule yesterday and was so excited with my new mini-home-theater that I invited my mother over to watch a movie. After tinkering with the Capsule for 3 hours, and NOT being able to watch any movie at all, I'm sadly writing this review. I bought this product because I was tired of watching movies on my computer, so I figured this would be a great option. The possibility of being able to mirror the screen of my computer seemed to be just what I needed. To my sad surprise, the mirroring is terrible. Not delayed-terrible, but mostly not-working-at-all-terrible.So if mirroring is not an alternative, I'm stuck with YouTube and Netflix and the other video apps that I'm not interested in.After a while of trying, we figured we'd just watch some stuff in YouTube. My only remaining option for unpayed content.Additionally to the POOR MIRRORING, the remote control works poorly or not at all. It got stuck, sometimes responsive, sometimes non-responsive. As other reviewers have said, the good thing is that the capsule app offers a much more effective controlling experience than the remote. So the problems of the defective/unoperative/limited remote seem to be solved if using the capsule control app.So now some pros: image was really good, sound ok. Not great but good considering the size of this soda-can shaped device.Beautifully designed, amazing little device for its size. So portability-wise it can't be better. I felt awe to see this tiny thing project such a good image.I understand it's a work in progress and that we're fortunate to have in the market a pico proyector that includes sound.I'm now facing the dilemma if to return it or not. With no mirroring, it's kind of useless for me.I'm not a tech person, so maybe there is an adaptor or cable that I can use to connect the capsule to my computer/iPad/phone and have the screen of my devices protected onto the wall. If this exists, I'll keep it. I loved the experience of a tv sized image (or bigger) anywhere in my home.However if such cable or adapter doesn't exist, I'll return the capsule and find a cheaper projector that can do the job of blowing up my computer screen onto a wall-sized image.Regardless of my seemingly negative review, I'm still amazed st the size and quality of the hardware.

257,Screencast Not Compatible With Google Pixel Phones,"I wanted to write and warn anyone who is thinking about purchasing this with a Google Pixel phone, the screencast does not work.The Nebula Capsule uses Miracast, which is not compatible with Pixels. I discovered this through my own research, as when I reached out to tech support I was met with the unhelpful response of asking if I followed the instructions for screencasting in the manual (which they then gave me the iOS instructions, despite the fact I specified I am using a Google Pixel with Android 8.1). When I told tech support that my own research shows that Miracast doesn't work with Pixels they confirmed that if you have a Google Pixel running Android 7 or higher, it will not work. I saw through my research that you can potentially get it to work if you root your phone and edit the build.prop, but just want to let people know before hand.I am very disappointed that the incompatibility is not disclosed anywhere, as a Google Pixel is a fairly mainstream phone. I was also disappointed with the lackluster help I received from tech support. I feel that Nebula should be more forthcoming with the compatibility of their devices and ensure this is disclosed in the description and specs.Compatibility issues aside, the unit is pretty great for the price point. Sound and picture are nice (the bluetooth functionality and Netflix still work, just screencasting that doesn't on a Pixel), so anyone with a compatible phone should be fine.",1.0,2018-03-13 00:00:00.000,screencast not compatible with google pixel phone,i want to write and warn anyone who be think about purchase this with a google pixel phone the screencast do not workthe nebula capsule use miracast which be not compatible with pixels i discover this through my own research as when i reach out to tech support i be meet with the unhelpful response of ask if i follow the instructions for screencasting in the manual which they then give me the ios instructions despite the fact i specify i be use a google pixel with android when i tell tech support that my own research show that miracast doesnt work with pixels they confirm that if you have a google pixel run android or higher it will not work i saw through my research that you can potentially get it to work if you root your phone and edit the buildprop but just want to let people know before handi be very disappoint that the incompatibility be not disclose anywhere as a google pixel be a fairly mainstream phone i be also disappoint with the lackluster help i receive from tech support i feel that nebula should be more forthcoming with the compatibility of their devices and ensure this be disclose in the description and specscompatibility issue aside the unit be pretty great for the price point sound and picture be nice the bluetooth functionality and netflix still work just screencasting that doesnt on a pixel so anyone with a compatible phone should be fine,"['want', 'write', 'warn', 'anyone', 'think', 'purchase', 'google', 'pixel', 'phone', 'screencast', 'workthe', 'nebula', 'capsule', 'use', 'miracast', 'compatible', 'pixels', 'discover', 'research', 'reach', 'tech', 'support', 'meet', 'unhelpful', 'response', 'ask', 'follow', 'instructions', 'screencasting', 'manual', 'give', 'ios', 'instructions', 'despite', 'fact', 'specify', 'use', 'google', 'pixel', 'android', 'tell', 'tech', 'support', 'research', 'show', 'miracast', 'doesnt', 'work', 'pixels', 'confirm', 'google', 'pixel', 'run', 'android', 'higher', 'work', 'saw', 'research', 'potentially', 'get', 'work', 'root', 'phone', 'edit', 'buildprop', 'want', 'let', 'people', 'know', 'handi', 'disappoint', 'incompatibility', 'disclose', 'anywhere', 'google', 'pixel', 'fairly', 'mainstream', 'phone', 'disappoint', 'lackluster', 'help', 'receive', 'tech', 'support', 'feel', 'nebula', 'forthcoming', 'compatibility', 'devices', 'ensure', 'disclose', 'description', 'specscompatibility', 'issue', 'aside', 'unit', 'pretty', 'great', 'price', 'point', 'sound', 'picture', 'nice', 'bluetooth', 'functionality', 'netflix', 'still', 'work', 'screencasting', 'doesnt', 'pixel', 'anyone', 'compatible', 'phone', 'fine']","['screencast', 'compatible', 'google', 'pixel', 'phone']"
258,Nebula Capsule Review Updated!,"My original review was based on receiving a used product.After speaking with Anker customer service I have to say that they went out of their way to try and resolve my issue, I wish all companies would work with their customers as well as Anker does.The product itself I only used for a very short time, and I will base my review on that.I loved the size of the unit, I was looking for something that could sit on a shelf when not in use and wouldn't take up a lot of space.While the lumens are not as high as some projectors, it was bright enough to see a clear picture in my darkened game room where it would have seen the majority of its use. The built in apps were an added bonus and I haven't seen other projectors with this extra functionality in this price range.Overall, if it was not for the unit having already been used I would have kept it and used it extensively.",3.0,2018-02-28 00:00:00.000,nebula capsule review update,my original review be base on receive a use productafter speak with anker customer service i have to say that they go out of their way to try and resolve my issue i wish all company would work with their customers as well as anker doesthe product itself i only use for a very short time and i will base my review on thati love the size of the unit i be look for something that could sit on a shelf when not in use and wouldnt take up a lot of spacewhile the lumens be not as high as some projectors it be bright enough to see a clear picture in my darken game room where it would have see the majority of its use the build in apps be an add bonus and i havent see other projectors with this extra functionality in this price rangeoverall if it be not for the unit have already be use i would have keep it and use it extensively,"['original', 'review', 'base', 'receive', 'use', 'productafter', 'speak', 'anker', 'customer', 'service', 'say', 'go', 'way', 'try', 'resolve', 'issue', 'wish', 'company', 'work', 'customers', 'well', 'anker', 'doesthe', 'product', 'use', 'short', 'time', 'base', 'review', 'thati', 'love', 'size', 'unit', 'look', 'something', 'could', 'sit', 'shelf', 'use', 'wouldnt', 'take', 'lot', 'spacewhile', 'lumens', 'high', 'projectors', 'bright', 'enough', 'see', 'clear', 'picture', 'darken', 'game', 'room', 'see', 'majority', 'use', 'build', 'apps', 'add', 'bonus', 'havent', 'see', 'projectors', 'extra', 'functionality', 'price', 'rangeoverall', 'unit', 'already', 'use', 'keep', 'use', 'extensively']","['nebula', 'capsule', 'review', 'update']"
259,Not impressed - welcome to dongle life,"I wanted to like the Nebula Capsule projector.  I really did ... the size and the speakers are delightful. To be fair, here is what I liked- small size- great sound (plenty loud enough)- able to install Amazon Prime Video and stream my movies over wifiHOWEVER, the Nebula Capsule has a number of issues that I can't stand.  For prospective buyers, you need to be aware of these problems:1. DIM PROJECTION --  If there is ANY ambient light, you will not be able to see the screen projected further than two feet. I can use it at night. Or in a bathroom with no windows. Or possibly camping under starlight. My kids can project onto a piece of paper a foot away.  At short range, the image looks great -- but what's the point when a tablet is the same size with better screen? I've used pico projectors years ago when they first came out, and expected the Nebula capsule to be brighter. It isn't.2. USB DONGLE LIFE -- I bought a 32gb (Fat32) USB flash drive to play back my movie collection. Unfortunately, the device ONLY has a micro-USB port so you have to use a dongle (included) to use USB flash drives.  Now my projector has a permanent rat's tail poking off the back. This looks dumb and you can't charge the device while using the USB dongle.3. REMOTE CONTROL REQUIRED -- This absolutely floored me.  I assumed I'd be able to control the device entirely with buttons on the projector.  Nope. You have to use the included remote control so you better not lose it. The capsule's amazing form factor becomes less impressive when you have to carry another accessory to make it work. The capsule phone app works pretty well but I'm not letting my kids have my phone just to pause their video.4. THE ROCKER BUTTON KIND OF SUCKS -- The device has four buttons on a rocker. Volume Up, Volume Down, Power, and Bluetooth speaker mode.  If my kids try to change volume -- or hold the device the wrong way -- the rocker activates the wrong button and the unit powers down or goes into bluetooth search mode.  The children then bring the projector back to me so I can find their video or use my remote to cancel the bluetooth error message. Poor design.5. CAN'T USE BUILT IN MEMORY -- I can't figure out how to do it.  I assumed the built-in file explorer would have a function for copying files off the USB and moving them into internal storage, but I can't find this function. I've never used android before, but I believe this is some kind of stripped down ""tv android.""  I tried plugging the projector into my clean Windows 10 PC and the Nebula doesn't show up as a storage device. What's the point of having all that memory if you can't put videos on it? For apps, I suppose.  I tried searching for online manual or PC drivers and can't find any manuals on on anker/nebula's website. The tiny printed manual is less than helpful. I guess I'm stuck watching videos off the dongle. I'm sure you techies have some weird workaround, but people shouldn't have to jump through hoops for this function.6. FIRMWARE  -- failed a few times. Finally downloaded completely, but the device wouldn't let me update until the battery was charged to over 50%.  It didn't matter that the device is plugged directly into the wall. This thing charges SLOW so I'm going to have to wait hours to install the firmware and see if it fixes any of these issues.  Update: it didn't.7. LOUD FAN -- I can live with this, but this is the loudest cooling fan I've ever had on a portable electronics device under five pounds. It almost sounds like white noise. Reminds me of the fan on my old 3000-lumen Epson projector - that device was 30 times brighter and used a halogen bulb, though.8. HARD TO ANGLE  -- the image is projected slightly upward and can't be aimed. The cylindrical shape and round footprint of the Nebula capsule make it hard to angle the device. If you slip a book under one edge, the capsule rolls over. The cube shaped projectors (like the Mars) are easier in this regard. You almost HAVE to get a tripod with this Nebula Capsule's round design.Summary - the Nebula capsule is a neat device, especially if it had come out years ago when the first pico projectors hit the scene. The form factor is cool and the sound is especially impressive for such a small gadget.  However, the projected screen is dim and the projector requires dongles and remote controls to use properly.The Mars seems like a better option as it is brighter (though only 500 ansi lumens), has a full-sized USB jack (no dongles), and most importantly has ALL the control buttons on top. I generally like Anker products (especially their battery packs) and wish the company much success.  However, I recommend passing on the Nebula Capsule. Mine is going back.",3.0,,not impress welcome to dongle life,i want to like the nebula capsule projector i really do the size and the speakers be delightful to be fair here be what i like small size

264,An Under Baked Device,"Yes, this is a projector the size of a soda can and that is impressive, but there are several major problems with it.1 - The limited Android app store is horrible. The only relevant apps I could use were Netflix and Youtube.

Issues came when I first plugged it in. Wouldn’t ever fully charge, in fact, it would try to charge but cycle on & off. When it did cycle on, the screen would light up for a couple of seconds and then turn off. I called Amazon and they tried to help but referred me to Ankers customer service #. I tried calling but since they’re in a different time zone were not available. For the price even on a “deal” wasn’t going to mess with it so I sent it back. Will say that for the moments the screen would come on, to have a great viewing you would have to be in a very dark room to get the best results.

266,Terrible software on pleasant hardware.,"Hardware wise this little device is impressive.  It's not without it's shortcomings, notably brightness (100 lumens) and resolution (854x480), but they're common for the size and class of the device although there are some with higher resolution.  The size, battery life, and speaker volume and quality are outstanding though and generally make up for any shortcomings.  There are a few minor things to be aware of, the projector lens isn't centered so it can take a little fiddling to get ""straight"" figured out and it is tall, and thus top heavy, so tripod angles might be more limited than comparable projectors.Software wise this thing is a mess though.  AirPlay blocks most things with copyright protection (e.g. Netflix, Hulu, etc).  Android streaming is limited to Miracast only.  The included Android apps and those on the app store either don't work (e.g. Hulu won't play any actual videos), are limited (e.g. you can't sign into YouTube due to the lack of Google Play Services), or are frustrating to use (e.g. Netflix is there but buggy and frustrating to navigate).  Anker knows most of this it seems, in emails with support they've indicated they're working with Google on resolving access to Google Play Services and they've noted that AirPlay functionality is outside of their control, but it still means the device doesn't live up to its promises here.  As an additional note the included remote doesn't seem to work well or at all with most of the software.A big selling feature of this device is the software, that you can install apps on it and watch your content, but truth be told you can't or you can't easily at this point.  You're left with fine hardware, arguably great for the size, but the device doesn't live up to the marketing Anker provides.  If you don't care about the software, it's a great projector who's only real issue is that the resolution could be higher (e.g. 720).  But, to me at least, I bought this with the software in mind and it completely fails in that aspect for now.Pros:+++ Speaker is loud and clear++ Long battery life+ PortableCons:- On the lower end of resolution (480)- Remote doesn't work fully with a lot of software- Casting support is limited (Airplay blocks copyright material and Android is only Miracast)--- Software support is very poor (doesn't work, is limited, etc)",3.0,2018-01-22 00:00:00.000,terrible software on pleasant hardware,hardware wise this little device be impressive its not without its shortcomings notably brightness lumens and resolution but theyre common for the size and class of the device although there be some with higher resolution the size battery life and speaker volume and quality be outstanding though and generally make up for any shortcomings there be a few minor things to be aware of the projector lens isnt center so it can take a little fiddle to get straight figure out and it be tall and thus top heavy so tripod angle might be more limit than comparable projectorssoftware wise this thing be a mess though airplay block most things with copyright protection eg netflix hulu etc android stream be limit to miracast only the include android apps and those on the app store either dont work eg hulu will not play any actual videos be limit eg you cant sign into youtube due to the lack of google play service or be frustrate to use eg netflix be there but buggy and frustrate to navigate anker know most of this it seem in email with support theyve indicate theyre work with google on resolve access to google play service and theyve note that airplay functionality be outside of their control but it still mean the device doesnt live up to its promise here as an additional note the include remote doesnt seem to work well or at all with most of the softwarea big sell feature of this device be the software that you can install apps on it and watch your content but truth be tell you cant or you cant easily at this point youre leave with fine hardware arguably great for the size but the device doesnt live up to the market anker provide if you dont care about the software its a great projector whos only real issue be that the resolution could be higher eg but to me at least i buy this with the software in mind and it completely fail in that aspect for nowpros speaker be loud and clear long battery life portablecons on the lower end of resolution remote doesnt work fully with a lot of software cast support be limit airplay block copyright material and android be only miracast software support be very poor doesnt work be limit etc,"['hardware', 'wise', 'little', 'device', 'impressive', 'without', 'shortcomings', 'notably', 'brightness', 'lumens', 'resolution', 'theyre', 'common', 'size', 'class', 'device', 'although', 'higher', 'resolution', 'size', 'battery', 'life', 'speaker', 'volume', 'quality', 'outstanding', 'though', 'generally', 'make', 'shortcomings', 'minor', 'things', 'aware', 'projector', 'lens', 'isnt', 'center', 'take', 'little', 'fiddle', 'get', 'straight', 'figure', 'tall', 'thus', 'top', 'heavy', 'tripod', 'angle', 'might', 'limit', 'comparable', 'projectorssoftware', 'wise', 'thing', 'mess', 'though', 'airplay', 'block', 'things', 'copyright', 'protection', 'eg', 'netflix', 'hulu', 'etc', 'android', 'stream', 'limit', 'miracast', 'include', 'android', 'apps', 'app', 'store', 'either', 'dont', 'work', 'eg', 'hulu', 'play', 'actual', 'videos', 'limit', 'eg', 'cant', 'sign', 'youtube', 'due', 'lack', 'google', 'play', 'service', 'frustrate', 'use', 'eg', 'netflix', 'buggy', 'frustrate', 'navigate', 'anker', 'know', 'seem', 'email', 'support', 'theyve', 'indicate', 'theyre', 'work', 'google', 'resolve', 'access', 'google', 'play', 'service', 'theyve', 'note', 'airplay', 'functionality', 'outside', 'control', 'still', 'mean', 'device', 'doesnt', 'live', 'promise', 'additional', 'note', 'include', 'remote', 'doesnt', 'seem', 'work', 'well', 'softwarea', 'big', 'sell', 'feature', 'device', 'software', 'install', 'apps', 'watch', 'content', 'truth', 'tell', 'cant', 'cant', 'easily', 'point', 'youre', 'leave', 'fine', 'hardware', 'arguably', 'great', 'size', 'device', 'doesnt', 'live', 'market', 'anker', 'provide', 'dont', 'care', 'software', 'great', 'projector', 'whos', 'real', 'issue', 'resolution', 'could', 'higher', 'eg', 'least', 'buy', 'software', 'mind', 'completely', 'fail', 'aspect', 'nowpros', 'speaker', 'loud', 'clear', 'long', 'battery', 'life', 'portablecons', 'lower', 'end', 'resolution', 'remote', 'doesnt', 'work', 'fully', 'lot', 'software', 'cast', 'support', 'limit', 'airplay', 'block', 'copyright', 'material', 'android', 'miracast', 'software', 'support', 'poor', 'doesnt', 'work', 'limit', 'etc']","['terrible', 'software', 'pleasant', 'hardware']"

287,"Two defective units right out of the box. Not good odds, skip this product.","It's neat, it works, the kids love movies outside. The user interface is clunky, and it's ridiculous they didn't add a micro sd slot, once you get past that it works for what it does, just could be a lot better.The trouble I have is, my micro usb slot is crooked, and makes inserting and removing the cable very difficult, and is scratching the heck out of the casing of the unit itself. I emailed anker, they, after sending pictures, CONFIRMED its it's a faulty unit, but since I purchased through Amazon's treasure truck sale, they have no record and insist I bought it 3rd party. Amazon refuses to send a simple replacement, stating I can return, and re purchase at the normal price ($120 more).So I have no choice but to purchase, or, rent another new unit, and send the faulty unit back for a full complete refund. I'm very disappointed in both companies in this refusal of very basic customer care.Update: Anker had reluctantly made an ""exception"" on my part to replace the defective unit. After receiving it, it does not connect to wifi, or rather, says it's connected, then displays connection error, on my home wifi, and 2 separate hotspots.
